# Conditional Circuit Switch - User Instructions

## Overview
The Conditional Circuit Switch is an interactive circuit simulation where you can manipulate five circuit nodes and observe their effects on a central switch.

## Basic Controls

### Circuit Nodes
- **Toggle Power**: Click any circuit to switch it ON/OFF
  - ON state: Green with "On" text
  - OFF state: Gray with "Off" text

- **Move Circuits**: 
  - Click and hold any circuit
  - Drag to desired location
  - Release to place

### Central Switch
The switch in the middle changes based on circuit positions and states:

#### Switch States
1. **Green (Fully Connected)**
   - Activates when either:
     - 2+ circuits are ON on both sides
     - 3 circuits ON one side + 2 ON other side

2. **Yellow (Semi-Connected)**
   - Activates when:
     - Exactly 1 circuit ON on left
     - Exactly 1 circuit ON on right

3. **Gray (Disconnected)**
   - Any other configuration

### Quick Actions
- Click the central switch to toggle ALL circuits simultaneously

## Tips & Tricks
- Experiment with different circuit arrangements
- Watch how crossing the center line affects the switch
- Try creating balanced configurations
- Use drag-and-drop to test different layouts

## Troubleshooting
If circuits become unresponsive:
1. Refresh the page
2. Ensure no circuits are stuck in drag mode
3. Check if cursor is within the browser window
